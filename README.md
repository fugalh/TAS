# TAS
Doug Gray presented a fantastic method for measuring true airpseed vectors (airspeed and heading) from GPS vectors (groundspeed and ground track).

Although his spreadsheet formulas work, I wanted to understand it more deeply and write some code. I re-learned some trig and geometry so I could re-derive what is going on here.
